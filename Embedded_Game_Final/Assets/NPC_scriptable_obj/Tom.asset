  - Hello, I am ginger road sign #1.
  - I just make certain expressions.
  - Just follow a fixed pattern.
  - I know you're not.
  - Try to walk around and show off your skills.
  - I thought you could do a double jump and punch.
  - Go for a walk anyway!
  - By the way, remember to find Hans! (I won't talk anymore)
